            <li>Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played among the teams in question</li>
            <li>higher number of goals scored in the matches played among the teams in question</li>
            <li>If,  after  having  applied  criteria  1)  to  3),  teams  still  have  an  equal  ranking,
            criteria 1) to 3) are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in
            question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a
            decision, criteria 5) to 8) apply</li>
            <li>Superior goal difference in all group matches</li>
            <li>Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;</li>
